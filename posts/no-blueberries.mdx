description: Lyrics to the song by DPR IAN.

I like no blueberries in my ice cream cake  
No air to breathe with that masking tape  
Stop, please  
I need a hostage free  
I need a rocket ship  
I need to run from  
I like no blueberries in my ice cream cake  
No air to breathe with that masking tape  
Stop, please  
I need a hostage free  
I need a rocket ship  
I need to run from  
From you  
I'm just kind of lost  
I fall from you  
I've been looking down a lot  
I fall from you  
I'm falling way too soft  
I fall from you  
Now tell me when to stop  
Here we go again to this beat  
(Oh no)  
Tell me why you want to be so sweet  
Tell me what's in your eyеs baby  
Red, green, or blue  
Welcomе to the other side  
I keep losing my temper for you  
I love it how you think I'm always this cool  
Excusez-Moi I think I'm just a fool  
Afraid of what's in your eyes baby  
Red, green, or blue  
Welcome to the other side  
I like no blueberries in my ice cream cake  
No air to breathe with that masking tape  
Stop, please  
I need a hostage free  
I need a rocket ship  
I need to run from  
From you  
I'm just kind of lost  
I fall from you  
I've been looking down a lot  
I fall from you  
I'm falling way too soft  
I fall from you  
Now tell me when to stop  
Coming to you live  
Yo mito  
Pass me the tape  
시끄러워  
Don't make me shoot  
A scene full of rappers  
전부 다 맛없어  
We need to go  
Drop to the floor  
움직여 we blow  
엊적엤어 너무 stylish  
The way we  
I'm a vibey villain  
Mi Amor  
Yeah oh  
She knows it  
She's in love with me  
And that's a drug in  
Dangerous doses  
And I'm  
In love with your poses  
Can't see straight  
Can't focus  
Get chills when  
I see your O-face  
You're the coldest  
(Alright cool)  
I like no blueberries in my ice cream cake  
No air to breathe with that masking tape  
Stop, please  
I need a hostage free  
I need a rocket ship  
I need to run from  
From you  
I'm just kind of lost  
I fall from you  
I've been looking down a lot  
I fall from you  
I'm falling way too soft  
I fall from you  
Now tell me when to stop  
So now you've blown all your covers  
I got this blue to make you come up  
So when you think it's almost over  
I got this blue to make you come up  
So now you've blown all your covers (before I forget)  
I got this blue to make you come up  
So when you think it's almost over (before I lose it)  
I got this blue to make you come up
